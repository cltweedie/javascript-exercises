// You're hanging out with your friends in a bar, when suddenly one of them is so drunk, that he can't speak,
// and when he wants to say something, he writes it down on a paper. However, none of the words he writes make sense to you.
// He wants to help you, so he points at a beer and writes "yvvi".
// You start to understand what he's trying to say, and you write a script, that decodes his words.

// Keep in mind that numbers, as well as other characters, can be part of the input, and you should keep them like they are.
// You should also test if the input is a string. If it is not, return "Input is not a string".
